# Portfolio

Here is an updated portfolio where I could display examples of my work, a link to my Github profile, and how to get in contact with me.
I wanted the user to be able to view my recent projects and access the deployed site and GitHub repo for those projects.

Using the framework, Bulma was to style my page and maintain its responsiveness. In addition, I also ensured that my page would be clean, simple and not too busy with color, and legible to read with appropriate font styles; making it stand out. Project cards are built using JavaScript that way it enables me to edit, add, and/or delete cards going forward. Learning the function of modals, I incorporated them into my portfolio allowing a user to navigate easily without having to view page to page. 

This webpage is a work in progress and so are my skills. The more I learn and maintain my skills, the more updated my Portfolio will come. Thank you for stopping by!
